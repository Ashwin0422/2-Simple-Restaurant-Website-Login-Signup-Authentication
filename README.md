It is a simple restaurant website with sign-in and sign-up authentication. I am mainly focused on sign-in and sign-up validations. I use Bootstrap's 12-column grid system for responsiveness. There are three pages: the home page, the sign-in or sign-up page, and the results page. I also implemented a login system for existing customers and integrated a sign-up feature for new customers.
